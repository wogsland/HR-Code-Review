HR Code Review
==============

So you're looking at a stack of resumes and you don't want to waste your
and your developers time talking to folks who have overstated their skills.
Wouldn't it be great if you could put in their GitHub username and get back
an quick analysis of all the publicly available code they've written?

HR Code Review does just that! It polls grades from Code Climate, information
from Travis CI, and ???
